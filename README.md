# Software Dependencies
- R version 4.0.4 (2021-02-15) -- Lost Library Book

# How to rerun things
In folders **team1, team2, team3, team4** you can find scripts to recreate the figure generated by our students. 

In each team folder you find a folder named **R**.
1. Install dependencies by running the following command, `source(file = "Dependencies.R")`. 
2. Run the individual .R script to recreate the corresponding figure. The filename of the scirpts correspond to the figure that will be reproduced.

All results will be placed in the **Results** folder.
